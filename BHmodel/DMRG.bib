	abstract = {The zero-temperature phase diagram of the one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model with nearest-neighbor interaction is investigated using the Density-Matrix Renormalization Group. Recently normal phases without long-range order have been conjectured between the charge density wave phase and the superfluid phase in one-dimensional bosonic systems without disorder. Our calculations demonstrate that there is no intermediate phase in the one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model but a simultaneous vanishing of crystalline order and appearance of superfluid order. The complete phase diagrams with and without nearest-neighbor interaction are obtained. Both phase diagrams show reentrance from the superfluid phase to the insulator phase.},

Symmetry-breaking and critical phenomena are ﬁrst discussed in the simpler setting of Monte Carlo studies of classical spin systems, to illustrate ﬁnite-size scaling at continuous and ﬁrst-order phase transitions. Exact diagonalization and quantum Monte Carlo (stochastic series expansion) algorithms and their computer implementations are then discussed in detail. Applications of the methods are illustrated by results for some of the most essential models in quantum magnetism, such as the S = 1/2 Heisenberg antiferromagnet in one and two dimensions, as well as extended models useful for studying quantum phase transitions between antiferromagnetic and magnetically disordered states.},

In the further development of the method, the realization that DMRG operates on a highly interesting class of quantum states, so-called matrix product states (MPS), has allowed a much deeper understanding of the inner structure of the DMRG method, its further potential and its limitations. In this paper, I want to give a detailed exposition of current DMRG thinking in the MPS language in order to make the advisable implementation of the family of DMRG algorithms in exclusively MPS terms transparent. I then move on to discuss some directions of potentially fruitful further algorithmic development: while DMRG is a very mature method by now, I still see potential for further improvements, as exempliﬁed by a number of recently introduced algorithms.},

	abstract = {The physical properties of a quantum many-body system can, in principle, be determined by diagonalizing the respective Hamiltonian, but the dimensions of its matrix representation scale exponentially with the number of degrees of freedom. Hence, only small systems that are described through simple models can be tackled via exact diagonalization. To overcome this limitation, numerical methods based on the renormalization group paradigm that restrict the quantum many-body problem to a manageable subspace of the exponentially large full Hilbert space have been put forth. A striking example is the density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG), which has become the reference numerical method to obtain the low-energy properties of one-dimensional quantum systems with short-range interactions. Here, we provide a pedagogical introduction to DMRG, presenting both its original formulation and its modern tensor-network-based version. This colloquium sets itself apart from previous contributions in two ways. First, didactic code implementations are provided to bridge the gap between conceptual and practical understanding. Second, a concise and self-contained introduction to the tensor network methods employed in the modern version of DMRG is given, thus allowing the reader to eﬀortlessly cross the deep chasm between the two formulations of DMRG without having to explore the broad literature on tensor networks. We expect this pedagogical review to ﬁnd wide readership amongst students and researchers who are taking their ﬁrst steps in numerical simulations via DMRG.},

              Messy, interacting quantum-mechanical systems are difficult to analyze theoretically. In a single spatial dimension, the calculations are still tractable, and experiments have recently confirmed the prediction that sufficiently strong disorder can disrupt the transport of interacting particles. In two dimensions, however, the theoretical blueprint is missing. Choi

            Single-site imaging in a two-dimensional optical lattice filled with interacting rubidium atoms shows that disorder can prevent thermalization.
          , 
            A fundamental assumption in statistical physics is that generic closed quantum many-body systems thermalize under their own dynamics. Recently, the emergence of many-body localized systems has questioned this concept and challenged our understanding of the connection between statistical physics and quantum mechanics. Here we report on the observation of a many-body localization transition between thermal and localized phases for bosons in a two-dimensional disordered optical lattice. With our single-site–resolved measurements, we track the relaxation dynamics of an initially prepared out-of-equilibrium density pattern and find strong evidence for a diverging length scale when approaching the localization transition. Our experiments represent a demonstration and in-depth characterization of many-body localization in a regime not accessible with state-of-the-art simulations on classical computers.},
