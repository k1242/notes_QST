Please write a short paper about your project. There are no strict length limits, but please write \textbf{at least two pages in the layout of this template} (including figures, excluding references and code listings). Please structure your paper in a scientific way, and include your references and your code. There are \LaTeX packages you can use to preserve the indentation of your code, e.g. the \texttt{listings} package which is demonstrated in the Appendix~\ref{app:codes}.

This sample document makes use of of REV\TeX~4.2, therefore you will need to install it to be able to compile this document yourself. Further information can be found in the REV\TeX~4.2
