@FOOTNOTE{Note1,key="Note1",note=" The MI phase is particularly notable for its role in ultracold atom experiments, where it facilitates the deterministic preparation of a single-site occupancy latticeâ€”a critical step in quantum simulation and computation experiments \cite {choi_exploring_2016}. "}
@FOOTNOTE{Note2,key="Note2",note=" The parameter $t$ represents the hopping amplitude between neighboring sites, $U$ denotes the on-site interaction strength, and $\mu $ is the chemical potential controlling the particle number. "}
@FOOTNOTE{Note3,key="Note3",note=" One could assume that the function $e^{-r/\xi } / r^{K/2}$ would describe the decay well across the entire phase space. However, such a fit is more unstable, and the phases can still be distinguished throughout the space by either $K$ or $\xi $. "}
