\begin{itemize}
	\iitem model is trained to predict probability distribution of the source vertex
	\iitem the shorter a path, the more likely it is to occur randomly
	\iitem the cumulative probability $p_1 p_2 \ldots$ of a random training scramble increases as the number of moves decreases.
	\iitem beam search (greedy algorithm) based on cumulative $p$
