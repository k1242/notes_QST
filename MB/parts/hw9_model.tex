
\textbf{Model}. We will study the effects of thermalization and localization using the Hubbard model 
\begin{equation}
	\hat{H} = 
	- J \sum_{\langle i,j\rangle} (\hat{a}_i\D \hat{a}_j + \hc) 
	+ V \sum_{\langle i,j\rangle} \hat{n}_i \hat{n}_j
	% + U 
	+ \Delta \sum_j \delta_j \hat{n}_j,
	\label{9:model}
\end{equation}
with $V$ -- nearest neighbor interaction, $\Delta$ -- noise level, $\delta_j \in [-1,1]$ evenly distributed (fig. \ref{fig:1Dmain}c). To obtain numerical results, the hard-bosons limit is used (unless explicitly stated otherwise)\footnote{
	The term $+ \tfrac{1}{2} U \sum_j \hat{n}_j (\hat{n}_j-1)$ was added to the Hamiltonian with $U \to \infty$. 
}.  This system is convenient in that we can look at various experimental implementations and all phases (EP and LP) of interest to us are implemented in it.
