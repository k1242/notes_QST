As a next step we calculate 
\begin{equation*}
	\exp\left(
		\sum_j c_j \eta_j
	\right) = 1 + \sum_j c_j \eta_j + 
	\sum_{j,k} c_j c_k \eta_j \eta_k = 
	 1 + \sum_j c_j \eta_j + 
	\sum_{j>k} c_j c_k (\eta_j \eta_k+\eta_k \eta_j) =  1 + \sum_j c_j \eta_j 
	,
\end{equation*}
with $c_j \in \mathbb{C}$. Actually it is the same as proof that $\sum_j c_j \eta_j $ is still Grassmann number by calculating anticommutative relations.
