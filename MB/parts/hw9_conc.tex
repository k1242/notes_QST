Experimental implementations and numerical simulations of EP and LP in the Hubbard model (or in 1D Heisenberg model) in 1D and 2D for the non-interacting case (EP-LP:AL) and the interacting case (EP-LP:MBL) are considered.
For a many-particle problem, the Hamiltonian is less sparse;
Hilbert Space Fragmentation, but thermalization usually occurs. A shift in the critical noise level required for transition to LP was observed due to the presence of interactions between particles. Also, fundamentally different behavior was observed in MBL compared to AL in terms of the growth of entanglement and entropy of subsystems.
