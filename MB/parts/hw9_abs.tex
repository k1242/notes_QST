This essay will consider two states of the system: the Ergodic Phase (EP), also known as thermalized, and the Localized Phase (LP). We start with defining these two phases and their experimental observation in 1D and 2D, look at how interaction affects the formation of phases. Then after some numerical calculations\footnote{
	Graphs from articles are accompanied by a link to the articles at the beginning, graphs without links are the results of my numerical modeling.
} we will try to formulate the main markers of EP and LP, perhaps highlighting the factors influencing their formation. Finally, we will separately consider the issue of the influence of interaction on the growth of entanglement between subsystems. We will also compare Anderson Localization (AL) and Many Body Localization (MBL).
